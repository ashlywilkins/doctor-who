      <h1>Origins</h1>
      <p>Within the fictional narrative, the Doctor is a Time Lord from the planet of Gallifrey who travels through time and space in his dimensionally transcendent—"bigger on the inside"—time machine, the TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimension(s) In Space) which took the exterior form of a 1963 police telephone call box that remains in the series.[2] His kind have dedicated themselves to overseeing all of time and space without interference. The Doctor chooses to leave his home by stealing an obsolete TARDIS model as revealed in the 1969 episode <em>The War Games</em> and re-depicted in the 2013 episode "The Name of the Doctor". With this vehicle, the Doctor explores the universe with mostly human companions who serve as audience surrogate characters to ask questions which allow the Doctor to provide relevant exposition."Doctor" is his self-selected alias. In later episodes of the new series, specifically under show runner Steven Moffat, the story arcs surrounding events in the Doctor's future implied serious consequences in the event of the Doctor's true name being spoken, the nature of which is finally revealed in "The Time of the Doctor". Spin-off media offers the explanation that his true name is unpronounceable by humans. In "The Name of the Doctor", the <a href="../the-doctors/characters/the-eleventh-doctor.html">Eleventh Doctor</a> tells companion <a href="../companions/characters/clara-oswald.html">Clara Oswald</a> that the name "Doctor" is essentially a promise he made. The promise itself is revealed in "The Day of the Doctor": "Never cruel nor cowardly. Never give up. Never give in."</p>
